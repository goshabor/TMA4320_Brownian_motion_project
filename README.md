# TMA4320_Brownian_motion_project

In this project, Casper Lindeman, Stian MÃ¦hre and I numerically analysed the Brownian motion of water molecules inside cells and discuss how Brownian motion and diffusion can be used to detect cancer cells inside the human body. The project code was written in Python and was our first numerical project at NTNU.
